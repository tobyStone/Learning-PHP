# Learning-PHP
range of exercises from "Beginning PHP 5.3" by Matt Doyle

Code courtesy of Matt Doyle.

Range of PHP programs as learning exercises using WAMPServer and Visual Studio Code.

Any feedback much appreciated (although there's probably not too much to say about this level of programming).

Thanks,

Toby
